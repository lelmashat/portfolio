This project involves the implementation and testing of a linked list and a user-defined dynamic array (ULListStr) in C++. The primary functionality includes creating, manipulating, and splitting linked lists based on even and odd values.

Key features include:
- Node Structure: A simple node structure is used to create linked lists, allowing for dynamic memory allocation.
- List Operations: Functions to create and delete lists, as well as to check the content of the lists against expected values.
- Recursive Splitting: A recursive function that separates a linked list into two distinct lists: one for even numbers and another for odd numbers.
- Dynamic String List: A ULListStr class that supports dynamic operations for storing and managing strings, including methods for adding, retrieving, and deleting elements.
- Testing Framework: Utilized Google Test (gtest) to ensure the correctness of linked list operations and ULListStr functionality.

The project showcases foundational data structures in C++ and emphasizes proper memory management and testing methodologies.
