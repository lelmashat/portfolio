This project focuses on implementing recursive functions for linked list processing. The task consists of two parts:

- Linked List Split/Pivot: A recursive function, llpivot, splits a singly-linked list into two output lists: one with elements less than or equal to a pivot, and the other with elements greater than the pivot. The function maintains the relative order of the elements, runs in O(n), and works with a single pass.

- Linked List Filter: A recursive function, llfilter, removes elements from a linked list based on a predicate provided by a functor. The function runs in O(n) and deallocates filtered nodes.

Both functions are designed to work with recursive structures and maintain efficiency through single-pass operations.
