This project involves creating a simplified online retail system, similar to platforms like Amazon. It allows users to interactively search for products from a provided database, manage a shopping cart, and make purchases. Key features include:

- Product Management: Support for three categories of products—books, clothing, and movies—with specific attributes for each category, such as ISBN for books, size and brand for clothing, and genre and rating for movies.
- User Interaction: Users can search for products using keywords, add items to their cart, view their cart, and complete purchases, while the system updates the database accordingly.
- Search Functionality: The program implements both AND/OR search capabilities to efficiently retrieve matching products based on user-input keywords, considering case insensitivity and special parsing rules for keywords.
- Database Management: User and product information is stored in a text database file, allowing for persistent updates and retrieval.

The project emphasizes understanding and extending provided code, including classes for users and products, as well as utilities for parsing and searching data efficiently.
